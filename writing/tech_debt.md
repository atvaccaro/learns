# What is (a) technical debt?
Borrowing future time to ship faster now by cutting corners.

Most of this is stolen from Martin Fowler's blog posts on the subject.

## [A Mess is not a Technical Debt.](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt)
Tech debt is a deliberate choice to move faster at the expense of future changes being more difficult and taking more time.
Bad code is not technical debt by itself; it could just be a mess.

## Why is it worth doing things correctly?
Keeping code quality high is actually cheaper eventually!
>* Neglecting internal quality leads to rapid build up of cruft
>* This cruft slows down feature development
>* Even a great team produces cruft, but by keeping internal quality high, is able to keep it under control
>* High internal quality keeps cruft to a minimum, allowing a team to add features with less effort, time, and cost.
